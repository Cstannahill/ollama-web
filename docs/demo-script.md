3. **Send a basic message**: "Hello, how are you?"
4. **Highlight features**:
   - Direct AI conversation
   - Fast response time
   - No additional processing steps

### 3. Agentic Mode Demonstration

1. **Switch to Agentic mode** using the mode selector
2. **Show the agentic welcome screen**:
   - Different information card
   - Advanced features explanation
   - Configuration requirements notice
3. **Open Enhanced Settings**:
   - Click the Settings button
   - Show the modal interface
   - Demonstrate mode-specific settings
   - Configure vector store path, embedding model, reranking model

### 4. Settings Panel Deep Dive

1. **General Settings Section**:
   - Temperature slider with real-time values
   - Top P nucleus sampling control
   - Top K token selection
   - Visual feedback and descriptions
2. **Agentic Mode Settings** (when in agentic mode):
   - Vector store path configuration
   - Embedding model selection
   - Reranking model settings
   - Configuration warnings

### 5. Agentic Mode Process Visualization

1. **Configure agentic mode properly** (if vector store available)
2. **Send a complex query** that would benefit from document search
3. **Show the process indicator**:
   - Real-time progress bar
   - Step-by-step process display
   - Document count and token usage
   - Professional loading states

### 6. Theme System Demonstration

1. **Toggle between light and dark modes**
2. **Show consistent styling** across all components
3. **Highlight modern design system**
