# Agentic Chat Enhancement Ideas

This page collects potential improvements specifically for the agentic chat mode. It expands on the high level notes in [../AF_ENH.md](../../AF_ENH.md) with examples tailored to the current implementation.

## Additional Ideas

1. **Real-Time Pipeline Visualization** – show a timeline of each retrieval and generation step.
2. **Parameter Presets** – store multiple named settings profiles for quick switching.
3. **Multi-Turn Retrieval** – use recent messages as search queries to maintain context.
4. **Smart Fallback** – automatically return to simple mode when persistent errors occur.
5. **Voice Dictation and Read-Aloud** – optional speech recognition and synthesis for accessibility.
6. **Shareable Session Links** – generate short-lived URLs to share conversations.
7. **Auto Summary on Long Responses** – display collapsible bullet summaries for lengthy outputs.
8. **Template-Based System Prompts** – allow reusable prompt templates with variables.
9. **Developer Debug Console** – expose verbose pipeline logs when enabled in settings.
10. **Data Export** – download conversation threads with the retrieved documents included.

These enhancements aim to make agentic chat more robust and versatile while keeping the user experience smooth.
