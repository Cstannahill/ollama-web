# Agentic Flow Enhancement Ideas

This document outlines potential improvements to strengthen the existing agentic workflow and its integration with the chat interface.

## Goals
- Provide a smoother user experience when switching between simple and agentic modes
- Increase resiliency of the agent pipeline against failures
- Offer richer functionality for advanced users
- Expand the pipeline to support new use cases

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Unified Pipeline Event Stream
- Formalize a typed event emitter for all pipeline stages.
- Consolidate status, metrics and error messages into a single stream.
- Allows components like `AgenticProcessIndicator` to subscribe once and render more consistent progress updates.

### 2. Graceful Timeout Handling
- Configure per-step timeouts (embedding, retrieval, reranking, generation).
- Abort a step with a clear error message if it exceeds its limit.
- Prevents the chat UI from hanging indefinitely when external services stall.

### 3. Incremental Context Retrieval
- Retrieve context documents in small batches and stream them to the UI.
- Users can see relevant snippets sooner while the remaining search completes in the background.
- Useful for large vector stores or slow disk access.

### 4. Conversation Memory Store
- Persist short conversation summaries in the vector store for long term recall.
- When starting a new thread, the pipeline can retrieve past summaries to maintain context across sessions.

### 5. Custom Tool Plugins
- Expose a lightweight plugin system for adding pipeline tools.
- Tools could perform web lookups, execute code, or query external APIs before generation.
- Users enable or disable plugins in **EnhancedChatSettings**.

### 6. Advanced Metrics Panel
- Expand the `PipelineMetrics` data to include token usage per step and cache hit rates.
- Display these metrics in a collapsible panel for debugging and optimization.

### 7. Conversation-Level System Prompts
- Allow a custom system prompt to be stored with each conversation.
- The agent pipeline uses this prompt when generating responses for that thread.

### 8. Improved Error UI
- Show detailed error summaries with remediation tips inside `AgentError`.
- Offer retry actions when failures are transient (e.g. network issues).

### 9. Offline Cache of Retrieved Docs
- Optionally cache retrieved documents locally so repeated questions load instantly.
- Include cache controls in the settings panel to purge or refresh stored data.

### 10. Flexible Pipeline Composition
- Provide a configuration screen for reordering or disabling individual pipeline steps.
- Developers can experiment with alternate flows without modifying core code.

### 11. Real-Time Pipeline Visualization
- Display an interactive timeline of each pipeline stage in the chat UI.
- Helps users understand where time is spent and debug issues quickly.

### 12. Parameter Presets
- Allow saving multiple named configuration presets for agentic settings.
- Enables quick switching between retrieval strategies or models.

### 13. Multi-Turn Retrieval
- Chain document retrieval across recent messages to maintain context over long conversations.
- Provides more coherent answers when a thread spans many turns.

### 14. Smart Fallback to Simple Mode
- Automatically revert to simple chat when the agentic pipeline encounters repeated errors.
- Prevents frustration from stalled conversations and logs the failure for later review.

### 15. Voice Dictation and Read-Aloud
- Integrate speech-to-text for message input and text-to-speech for responses.
- Improves accessibility and hands-free usage.

### 16. Shareable Session Links
- Generate short-lived links to share a conversation thread with its context.
- Useful for collaborative troubleshooting or showcasing answers.

### 17. Auto Summary on Long Responses
- Summarize lengthy model outputs into bullet points displayed in a collapsible section.
- Lets users scan key takeaways without scrolling.

### 18. Template-Based System Prompts
- Provide reusable system prompt templates with variable placeholders.
- Users can customize prompts without rewriting them for every chat.

### 19. Developer Debug Console
- Expose optional verbose logs and intermediate queries in an advanced panel.
- Assists power users in tuning retrieval quality.

### 20. Data Export of Context and Messages
- Export the conversation along with referenced documents as a bundled archive.
- Facilitates offline review and sharing outside the application.

### 21. Resumable Pipeline Execution
- Save intermediate pipeline state so long-running steps can resume after interruptions.

### 22. Step Output Caching
- Cache results of expensive stages like embedding or retrieval to avoid repeated work.

### 23. Adaptive Retrieval Depth
- Dynamically adjust the number of documents retrieved based on conversation length.

### 24. Pre/Post Step Hooks
- Allow custom functions to run before and after each pipeline stage for advanced control.

### 25. Multimodal Document Support
- Retrieve and display images or other media alongside text context.

### 26. Security and Permission Controls
- Let users restrict plugin access to local files or network resources.

### 27. Cloud Sync
- Optionally synchronize settings and conversations across devices.

### 28. Workflow Templates
- Save common sequences of agentic actions as reusable templates.

### 29. Scheduled Background Agents
- Run agentic pipelines on a schedule and post results when ready.

### 30. Onboarding Tour for Agentic Mode
- Provide a guided walkthrough of advanced features when agentic mode is enabled.

### 31. Multi-Vector Store Support
- Allow configuring and querying multiple vector stores.
- Supports hybrid knowledge bases for specialized domains.

### 32. Role-Based Permissions
- Restrict advanced settings and plugins based on user roles.
- Protects sensitive actions like document indexing or plugin management.

### 33. Multi-Agent Coordination
- Chain multiple agents with specialized skills within a single conversation.
- Enables complex workflows such as research followed by summarization.

### 34. Automated Index Updates
- Schedule background tasks to refresh vector stores from new documents.
- Keeps knowledge sources up to date without manual intervention.

### 35. Real-Time Collaboration
- Allow multiple users to join the same conversation and share context.
- Useful for pair programming or team troubleshooting sessions.

### 36. User Feedback Loop
- Let users rate responses and flag issues directly in the chat interface.
- Pipeline adapts over time based on aggregated feedback.

### 37. Themed Pipeline States
- Customize UI colors or animations for each pipeline step.
- Provides clearer visual cues during complex operations.

### 38. Per-Step Model Switching
- Choose different LLMs or embedding models for individual pipeline stages.
- Optimizes cost and quality by matching models to tasks.

### 39. Global Conversation Search
- Full-text search across all saved conversations and context documents.
- Quickly locate past answers or reference material.

### 40. Interactive Coaching Mode
- Display detailed explanations of each pipeline step while processing.
- Helps new users understand how agentic mode works.

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize enhancements based on user feedback and performance metrics.
2. Break down each improvement into standalone tasks under `docs/` with design sketches and type updates.
3. Ensure all new types live in `types/langchain` or related folders as defined in `AGENTS.md`.

These ideas aim to evolve the current agentic flow into a more robust and extensible system while keeping the chat experience responsive and user friendly.
